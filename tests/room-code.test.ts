// room-code.test.ts — live-P2P contract gate #1. A room code is read off one phone screen and typed

// Every one of those spellings must canonicalise to the exact bytes the invite link carries, or the
// two players land in two different rooms and each sits watching a lobby say "waiting for a friend"
// for ever, with no error anywhere to tell them why.
